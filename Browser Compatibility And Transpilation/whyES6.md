The version of JavaScript that preceded ES6 is called JavaScript ES5. Three reasons for the ES5 to ES6 updates are listed below:

Readability and economy of code — The new syntax is often easier to understand (more readable) and requires fewer characters to create the same functionality (economy of code).

Addresses sources of ES5 bugs — Some ES5 syntax led to common bugs. With ES6, Ecma introduced syntax that mitigates some of the most common pitfalls.

A similarity to other programming languages — JavaScript ES6 is syntactically more similar to other object-oriented programming languages. This leads to less friction when experienced, non-JavaScript developers want to learn JavaScript.

Because ES6 addressed the above issues, Ecma knew that adoption by web developers would occur quickly, while web browser support lagged behind.

To limit the impact of ES6 browser compatibility issues, Ecma made the new syntax backwards compatible, which means you can map JavaScript ES6 code to ES5.
