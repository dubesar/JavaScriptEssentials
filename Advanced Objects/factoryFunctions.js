/*
there are times where we want to create many instances of an object quickly. 
Here’s where factory functions come in. 
A real world factory manufactures multiple copies of an item quickly and on a massive scale. 
A factory function is a function that returns an object and can be reused to make multiple object instances. 
Factory functions can also have parameters allowing us to customize the object that gets returned.
