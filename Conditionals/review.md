2.if...else statements make binary decisions and execute different code blocks based on a provided condition.

3.We can add more conditions using else if statements.

4.Comparison operators, including <, >, <=, >=, ===, and !== can compare two values.

5.The logical and operator, &&, or “and”, checks if both provided expressions are truthy.

6.The logical operator ||, or “or”, checks if either provided expression is truthy.

8.The bang operator, !, switches the truthiness and falsiness of a value.

9.The ternary operator is shorthand to simplify concise if...else statements.
